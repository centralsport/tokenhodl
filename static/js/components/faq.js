        You can claim the amount of the BNB based on the ratio of $HODL you hold / the total BNB pool.For example, you hold 1 % of $HODL, you can withdraw 1 % of the BNB reward pool. <

        If you don’ t claim at your cycle and other holders claim, the BNB pool will reduce.So then the ratio of your $HODL / BNB pool reduces as well.That’ s why you should claim as soon as your cycle is ready <

        Simply holding $HODL will earn you a share of the BNB rewards pool, proportional to the amount of $HODL you hold.You will also earn $HODL passively too, which gets put straight in your wallet <

        The specific time you can claim depends on a few factors.The collection time is every 24 hours.Be aware however, that
        if you purchase a significant amount more $HODL than your initial purchase, your collection time will be moved back, and
        if you sell all your $HODL and buy back in , your collection date will be pushed years out into the future.This is not a bug, it 's a feature that helps prevent scalping.

        No.This is because it 's not "your" BNB, meaning it is not an amount of BNB that is set aside for you, but rather a set share of the pool of BNB. As people claim their BNB, the total pool will decrease, which in turn means the BNB value of your set share will decrease. In short, it is best to claim your BNB as soon as possible. <

        Several factors impact BNB claim amount. < br / >
        1. The amount of BNB in the pool is distributed based on percentage.The more BNB there, the more you get, however, it is ALWAYS based on percentage.The less there, the less you get.IT IS NOT CUMULATIVE < br / >
        2. The more people claim, the less BNB will be available
        for everyone
        else <br / >
            3. There is a cycle before you can collect BNB and the more transactions you make with this coin, the more the cycle changes.Be aware of that when you are thinking of selling high to buy low <
